Poem	Notes
They say an English man’s home is his castle. But what do they think about a dog’s home that is literally a castle? Does my home make me an English man? I hope not. Change could be a good thing but I think being a dog is quite alright and I’m starting to enjoy this.  [date] Dog. [sign]	
Ah to be petted, that’s the thing I can get from ape limbs beings (mostly humans). I gotta admit that it’s a bit weird because it’s like us saying that we cannot exist without humans. But maybe I don’t really want to live without them? Or maybe I want them around? I gotta say, whatever it is, it’s actually nice to be man’s best friend; we can be the best unconditionally.

I know something about humans and it’s that they like balls very much. They think they live on a big ball surrounded by other big balls and they love talking about those balls all the time from their alignments to the amount of balls they’d give to the art. I like balls too. I don’t know what it is but it’s very exciting to see them bounce and to put them in my mouth. We got something in common, my human friend. [date] Dog 	
Were you wondering how I write this thing? It’s actually not that hard. Snoopy has been writing novels since the 1950s. Writing is a normal activity for dogs. It’s just one of those things that aren’t for everyone. But I do! [date] Dog	
Did you check out Brutalist Dance? As a dog, I don’t really claim to have the good grasp of artefacts and other human creations within the cultural and historical contexts and all that but man, brutalist art and architecture makes me wanna chew it. Something about it makes me think about biting into a big, scrumptious bone. And all that dancing and lights? Woof boi, am I hungry.  [date] Dog	
Did you see Mind the Gap? I recognised the thing that carries you between the high places and the low places. I’ve been on one of them! It took me to a place where the air smelt different!!!!! I wonder what that vehicle takes you to, though. I sniffed it and it smelt different.  [date] Dog	
I think I have a pretty decent nose and I enjoy smelling things. I do like smelling many things but smelling plants is something I, bees, and humans seem to have in common. Based on my own observation, it looks like humans are not very good at detecting them like bees and me but they seem to be very fond of the idea of smelling flowers. It could just be a mammals survival instincts thing (do whales smell things?) but it’s cool to see other species doing what I do.  [date] Dog	
 I read (in case you didn’t know). And I read that it’s common for a human to ask another human where they see themselves in the future. And if they ask you this, they are probably not expecting you to say something like “I’ll be eating because it’s about the time I should eat in the future” or “I’ll be smelling the rain because I think it’s going to rain in the future”. They want you to have some kind of higher expectations in your life where you have something that you don’t have right now. They don’t want you to say that you’d be past your life expectation either because they want to hear something realistic but also optimistic. I don’t know the purpose nor significance of those questions and I find y’all funny for being so obsessed with the unknown times in a twisted manner but I respect that you have a weird custom.

The way your limbs work and the way my limbs work are quite different. I can lick my front paws but it’s not the easiest set of paws to lick while for you humans, it seems like the front paws are the easiest part of the body to lick. You lick your paws to taste the food that you were holding. I also sometimes use my front paws to hold food but it’s not easy to lick my paws like you lot do. This is so unfair. [date] Dog 	
Do you know this human wizard called Luciano Pavarotti? They wear a penguin dress and live in a rectangle. And when they sing, I can't help but start howling like crazy wild animals! I don't know how they do that and I don't know if I'm wasting my time and energy like that but their sorcery makes me feel euphoric and fantastic. So I guess it's good magic? After all, I think we dogs are made to have fun and good times. I shouldn't feel shy about this. Awooo [date] Dog	
That's the way arf arf arf I like it arf arf arf [date] Dog	
Someone looked at me and said “I love dogs because they love you unconditionally” and I thought, excuse me? I don’t just go about and love anyone without a reason??? There’s gotta be some kind of a transaction. But then I realised that I don’t have reasons for why I love most of the things I love. I guess I do have unconditional love. [date] Dog	
I recently learnt a Japanese proverb which goes like “a dog walks and then runs into a pole” and I’ve been a little bit excessively self conscious ever since.  [date] Dog	
Who let the dog out? YOU!!!! (hey yippie yi yo) [date] Dog	
Have you ever heard of this spectacular story about dogs (and the members of other species) saving a whole bunch of Dalmatians through team work involving an excellent interspecies communication system? I don’t know if I feel properly represented in that but I like how it gives me hope in our world? Yeah I do. [date] Dog  	
How would I wear trousers? Well, I’ve never worn them in the first place but since I’m legally allowed to be naked and it seems like there’s not even a conventional way for dogs to wear trousers, I guess I can wear them any way I want to? I mean, you humans should be able to do that (to a degree maybe but how would I know about the human rules)  [date] Dog
