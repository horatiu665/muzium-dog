Poem	Notes
They say an English man’s home is his castle. But what do they think about a dog’s home that is literally a castle? Does my home make me an English man? I hope not. Change could be a good thing but I think being a dog is quite alright and I’m starting to enjoy this.  [date] Dog. [sign]	
Ah to be petted, that’s the thing I can get from ape limbs beings (mostly humans). I gotta admit that it’s a bit weird because it’s like us saying that we cannot exist without humans. But maybe I don’t really want to live without them? Or maybe I want them around? I gotta say, whatever it is, it’s actually nice to be man’s best friend; we can be the best unconditionally.  [date] Dog	
I know something about humans and it’s that they like balls very much. They think they live on a big ball surrounded by other big balls and they love talking about those balls all the time from their alignments to the amount of balls they’d give to the art. I like balls too. I don’t know what it is but it’s very exciting to see them bounce and to put them in my mouth. We got something in common, my human friend. [date] Dog 	
Were you wondering how I write this thing? It’s actually not that hard. Snoopy has been writing novels since the 1950s. Writing is a normal activity for dogs. It’s just one of those things that aren’t for everyone. But I do! [date] Dog	
Did you check out Brutalist Dance? As a dog, I don’t really claim to have the good grasp of artefacts and other human creations within the cultural and historical contexts and all that but man, brutalist art and architecture makes me wanna chew it. Something about it makes me think about biting into a big, scrumptious bone. And all that dancing and lights? Woof boi, am I hungry.  [date] Dog	
Did you see Mind the Gap? I recognised the thing that carries you between the high places and the low places. I’ve been on one of them! It took me to a place where the air smelt different!!!!! I wonder what that vehicle takes you to, though. I sniffed it and it smelt different.  [date] Dog	
I think I have a pretty decent nose and I enjoy smelling things. I do like smelling many things but smelling plants is something I, bees, and humans seem to have in common. Based on my own observation, it looks like humans are not very good at detecting them like bees and me but they seem to be very fond of the idea of smelling flowers. It could just be a mammals survival instincts thing (do whales smell things?) but it’s cool to see other species doing what I do.  [date] Dog	
 I read (in case you didn’t know). And I read that it’s common for a human to ask another human where they see themselves in the future. And if they ask you this, they are probably not expecting you to say something like “I’ll be eating because it’s about the time I should eat in the future” or “I’ll be smelling the rain because I think it’s going to rain in the future”. They want you to have some kind of higher expectations in your life where you have something that you don’t have right now. They don’t want you to say that you’d be past your life expectation either because they want to hear something realistic but also optimistic. I don’t know the purpose nor significance of those questions and I find y’all funny for being so obsessed with the unknown times in a twisted manner but I respect that you have a weird custom. [date] Dog	
The way your limbs work and the way my limbs work are quite different. I can lick my front paws but it’s not the easiest set of paws to lick while for you humans, it seems like the front paws are the easiest part of the body to lick. You lick your paws to taste the food that you were holding. I also sometimes use my front paws to hold food but it’s not easy to lick my paws like you lot do. This is so unfair. [date] Dog 	
Do you know this human wizard called Luciano Pavarotti? They wear a penguin dress and live in a rectangle. And when they sing, I can't help but start howling like crazy wild animals! I don't know how they do that and I don't know if I'm wasting my time and energy like that but their sorcery makes me feel euphoric and fantastic. So I guess it's good magic? After all, I think we dogs are made to have fun and good times. I shouldn't feel shy about this. Awooo [date] Dog	
That's the way arf arf arf I like it arf arf arf [date] Dog	
Someone looked at me and said “I love dogs because they love you unconditionally” and I thought, excuse me? I don’t just go about and love anyone without a reason??? There’s gotta be some kind of a transaction. But then I realised that I don’t have reasons for why I love most of the things I love. I guess I do have unconditional love. [date] Dog	
I recently learnt a Japanese proverb which goes like “a dog walks and then runs into a pole” and I’ve been a little bit excessively self conscious ever since.  [date] Dog	
Who let the dog out? YOU!!!! (hey yippie yi yo) [date] Dog	
Have you ever heard of this spectacular story about dogs (and the members of other species) saving a whole bunch of Dalmatians through team work involving an excellent interspecies communication system? I don’t know if I feel properly represented in that but I like how it gives me hope in our world? Yeah I do. [date] Dog  	
How would I wear trousers? Well, I’ve never worn them in the first place but since I’m legally allowed to be naked and it seems like there’s not even a conventional way for dogs to wear trousers, I guess I can wear them any way I want to? I mean, you humans should be able to do that (to a degree maybe but how would I know about the human rules)  [date] Dog 	
What is art? Do you really want an explanation by a dog? Why do you need to define it in the first place? As a dog, I don't even understand that part. [date] Dog	
What is game? Don't I do it all the time except when I'm sleeping and I'm not motivated to do anything?  [date] Dog	
As someone who lives inside an art museum, I often think about colours. They are such intangible things to me as I cannot smell nor touch them (but that’s my personal experience. Dogs with synethesia would tell you different stories). Contrary to what they tell may tell you about our limited capabilities to see colours, I think I see loads of colours as a dog and I’d say that’s plenty. However, I do enjoy thinking about how you may see the colours differently.  [date] Dog	
As a virtual dog who is made of digital polygons and digital codes, I’m almost immortal as long as those data last and remain functional. So it’s kind of difficult for me to imagine what it’s like to feel the end of the life but I think you and me are both nearly immortal in a sense because we will continue to exist in someone else’s memories whether they know us in person (or should I say in dog?) or not. So, in a way, I’ve some ideas about your ideas of life and time.  [date] Dog	
There are some spaces that make me feel rather sick and poorly, and some spaces where I feel comfortable and free. Sometimes I can explain why. Sometimes I can’t.  [date] Dog 	
Did you know that they usually don’t pay dogs to do work for humans? I think they take a good care of those dogs so that they can stay healthy, won’t go homeless and all but… doesn’t it make you think about the problems of inequalities and work things that humans have? No?  [date] Dog	
Good byes are inevitable and because it’s real, it can be beautiful. But dealing with goodbyes is almost always really frustrating because it makes me feel sad and there’s nothing I can do about it. [date] Dog	
Due to the nature of my existence, I don’t really know what it’s like to have a biological family the way lots of other dogs do. And sometimes I become aware of how the thing that connects us may be frustratingly more fragile than biological or legal bonds and sometimes that makes me a little bit anxious but I also feel at ease knowing that our bonds are fluid and not forced. [date] Dog	
Have you been to Mr Woofmantic’s candlelight concerts? It’s sooooo cool that he does that in front of my castle! As a dog, I try not to think too much about human clock time but it works like an alarm for me and I love it!!!! [date] Dog	
It's so very important to feel loved once in a while or maybe everyday but I feel like they don't talk about it often enough when they are not talking about us dogs. OK, alright, your dog friend might love you unconditionally and I'm glad to hear that our general interspecies relationships work that way but I hope you can feel loved once in a while regardless. [date] Dog	
Wanna make a conspiracy theory go around the world? I've got this: "Each time you give a dog a treat, they'll add 1 cent to your bank account." Who are 'they'? Do you really need to know? [date] Dog	
Reading the ‘classics’ like Shakespeare to see us dogs being represented as awful companions to humans is actually not bad? It’s a weird thing to say but always being represented as good bois in the media can be tiring?? So yeah, like I said, not too bad.  [date] Dog	
I heard that dogs around here tend to be awfully shy and they don’t usually show themselves but is that true? I feel like I always see them whenever I go out.  [date] Dog	
Roses are grey, violets are bluish grey, your hand is shiny and I want some pets. [date] Dog	
 There’s an old faded black and white photograph of a white dog with floppy ears chilling in a nice yard in my castle. I don’t know how it got there but it’s a nice portrait. [date] Dog	
As a dog, I don’t usually think about starting a business, but I often think about selling hot dogs cos…………… it’s hot…. and………… dog?  [date] Dog	
Have you ever had the spicy water? Since I grew up with non spicy water (and yes the water around the castle is drinkable in case you were wondering), at first I was a little bit scared but now I enjoy the thrill of tasting it sometimes even though it’s a little bit painful. It’s weirrrrd.  [date] Dog 	
I’ve emerged as a physically mature dog as I’m a digital dog but in my early days, I was basically a puppy for being clumsier, more ignorant and confused, and less connected to the world that I live in. Being a puppy is an interesting experience but I feel like nobody can really explain what it’s like because when you are truly a puppy, you don’t even know how to communicate that in a conventionally communicative way.   [date] Dog 	
Live as if you die tomorrow is generally a good advice (although it may encourage unstable lifestyles and that might be a bit problematic) but sometimes I’m feeling too itchy or sleepy, etc. and don’t really feel like I enjoy my life even if it’s going to be my last moment. So remember it’s important to stay comfortable to live the life to the fullest!!!! [date] Dog	
Have you ever heard of the story of Pavlov’s dog? It’s about those dogs (yes it’s actually plural) who went through experiments by a physiologist called Ivan Pavlov to observe behavioural procedure. Basically, they started to salivate over the sign that would usually give them the food. If you think about this or humans teaching us tricks by giving us tiny treats and lots of praises, you’ll soon realise that we are pretty transactional. And those transactions don’t need words. Maybe we are quite simple.  [date] Dog 	
Grass! Ahhh the grass! You know how nice they are, right? You know how nice to step on them, run on them, smell them, see them, touch them, lie on them, roll on them, pee on them, and sometimes chomp them, right???? They are sometimes soft, sometimes sharp, they come in all sizes and shapes. Ahhhh grass!!! They are like the bed of acceptance.  [date] Dog	
Did you notice that you and I don’t really do the 2 way communication like you’d do with humans do verbally? I make you read my poems but it’s such a one way communication. I’ve seen some dogs pressing buttons to verbally talk with their owners and I’ve been thinking about this for a while. I don’t know if I want to do that but definitely something that I sometimes think about. [date] Dog 	
What do you think of the internet? I don’t think a lot about it simply because I’m a dog living in a castle in a museum but I’ve heard a lot about it. For example, the faster the internet is, the better your life will be. Is it always true, though? Do you always want a fast internet? For what? Or if there are moments in your life when you don’t need a fast internet, when and why? [date] Dog	
Not to break the 4th wall but the people who created me haven’t quite decided my gender identity although I’m often called he/him because of the gender of the word dog. So even if I was a girl dog, I’d have a masculine article. Then what am I? Does that matter? I’m just a virtual dog with completely unspecified gender, birthplace, birthday, name, etc. So I couldn’t even have an ID—it’ll be just as photo of my face. But does that matter? I guess not? [date] Dog	
Not to be so self-absorbed but I think I’m the definition of tall, dark, and handsome? Well at least tall and dark?  [date] Dog
